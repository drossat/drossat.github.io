As a research engineer at EDF R&D (EDF Lab Paris Saclay), my work focuses on structural mechanics and applied mathematics. My research interests include work based on uncertainty quantification, Bayesian modeling, inverse problems and data assimilation, within the field of mechanics. I also contribute to the development of the code_aster finite element code, as well as calculation tools based on it, mainly in the field of structural dynamics. My main fields of application are rotordynamics, fuel assembly dynamics and civil engineering.
